# Sample Status

This file tracks the current state of the local sample corpus as it relates to
emulator behavior.

## `arm64_hello`

- Path: [fixtures/macos/bin/arm64_hello](D:/dev/quiling/qiling/fixtures/macos/bin/arm64_hello)
- Role: smoke-test fixture
- Expected status: should execute successfully
- Current note: used as the primary quick validation sample for `cargo build --bin machina` and basic runtime checks

## `2d0dda75bfc90e7ffda72640eb32c7ff9f51c90c30f4a6d1e05df93e58848f36.macho`

- Path: [fixtures/macos/bin/2d0dda75bfc90e7ffda72640eb32c7ff9f51c90c30f4a6d1e05df93e58848f36.macho](D:/dev/quiling/qiling/fixtures/macos/bin/2d0dda75bfc90e7ffda72640eb32c7ff9f51c90c30f4a6d1e05df93e58848f36.macho)
- Family: AMOS stealer
- Architecture: arm64
- Current observed status:
  - reaches `_main.main`
  - reaches `_main.GrabWallets`
  - reaches `_main.GrabChrome`
  - reaches `_main.GrabFirefox`
  - probes browser and wallet paths
  - reads synthetic fallback content from guest filesystem policy
- Important implication:
  - emulator is already past bootstrap/runtime-only execution and into real stealer logic
  - next compatibility work should focus on richer profile traversal and artifact semantics rather than simple `ENOENT` fixes

- Path: [fixtures/macos/bin/0393e898f4425195d780346634e619b80f283a8223b9724db56dee87afbba486.macho](D:/dev/quiling/qiling/fixtures/macos/bin/0393e898f4425195d780346634e619b80f283a8223b9724db56dee87afbba486.macho)
- Current observed status:
  - retained as a large arm64 analysis target
- Important implication:
  - this sample is both an execution target and a reverse-engineering reference set

## Corpus hygiene

- New samples should be added with a short status note here.
